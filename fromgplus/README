This extension fetches messages from a Google+ account and reshares it.

You have to place the following config values in your .htconfig.php:

$a->config['fromgplus']['key'] = "your key";
$a->config['fromgplus']['poll_interval'] = 10;

You need an API key for "Simple API Access". 

You get it via https://code.google.com/apis/console/ and then "API Access".
