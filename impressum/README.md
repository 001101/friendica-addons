About
-----

In the notes and postal fields you can use bbcode tags for formatting, like in normal friendica postings..

Configuration
-------------
Simply fill in the fields in the impressium settings page in the addons area of your admin panel. For email adresses the "@" symbol will be obfuscated in the source of the page to make in harder for harvesting tools.
