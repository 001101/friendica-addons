This isn't even close to being worth a pull request, but some people might find it useful.

Enable community home in your admin panel, then replace communityhome.php with this one to get a front page like mine (a normal front page, but with latest users shown in the sidebar, which looks bleak when there's nothing in it).

There are more graceful ways of doing this, I used communityhome as I plan to make use of a limited stream and likes in future.
