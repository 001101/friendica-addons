Community Home
--------------

This plugin overwrites the default home page shown to not logged users.
On sidebar there are the login form, last ten users (if they have 
choosed to be in site directory), last ten public photos and last ten
"likes" sent by a site user or about a site user's item

In main content is shown the community stream. This plugin doesn't 
honour your community page visibility site setting: the community 
stream is shown also if you have choose to not show the community page.
