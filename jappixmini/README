Jappix Mini Plugin
==================

This quick-and-dirty addon allows you to add a Jabber-based, Facebook-like chat
to Friendica. It uses Jappix Mini.

It is necessary to use a BOSH proxy - so to use this plugin, you need to know the
address of a BOSH proxy that works with your account.

The addon has an experimental autosubscribe and autosuggest functionality which tries
to add your Friendica contacts to your roster automatically.

Installation
------------

Jappix Mini (AGPL license) is not distributed with this addon. You need to
install it manually:

* Download latest zip file named friendica-addon-* from
  https://github.com/Leberwurscht/jappix/tags and place the zip file in the addon
  folder. Make sure to name it 'jappix.zip' - the download link required by the AGPL
  points there.
* Unpack the zip file, rename the folder to 'jappix'. Do not delete jappix.zip.
