Jappix Mini Plugin
==================

This quick-and-dirty addon allows you to add a Jabber-based, Facebook-like chat
to Friendica. It uses Jappix Mini.

It is necessary to use a BOSH host - so to use this plugin, each users need to
know the address of a BOSH host that works with his account. The BOSH server of
the Jappix project (https://bind.jappix.com/) is not locked to a specific XMPP
provider, but keep in mind that only personal usage is approved according to
http://codingteam.net/project/jappix/doc/BoshServer.
If you have a larger server, it is recommended that you install your own BOSH
server and recommend it using the configuration help field. If it is on the
same server, you can also deactivate the BOSH proxy. This should improve the
performance.

The addon has an experimental autosubscribe and autosuggest functionality which
tries to add your Friendica contacts to your roster automatically.

Limitations:
 - Jabber passwords can only be encrypted if they are at most 39 characters
   long.

Installation
------------

Jappix Mini (AGPL license) is not distributed with this addon. You need to
install it manually:

* Download latest jappix version from https://github.com/jappix/jappix/tags to
  addon/jappixmini/jappix.zip. Really make sure you name it 'jappix.zip' - the
  download link required by the AGPL points there.
* Unpack the zip file to addon/jappixmini/jappix/. Do not delete jappix.zip.
* Delete the file addon/jappixmini/jappix/index.php. This is important, because
  otherwise the installer of Jappix would be publicly accessible. If you are
  lucky, the file is deleted automatically by the addon.
